# ManagedCallStack
Managed call stack for .NET applications

This is built using [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime/)  
 The debug shim works to process specific processor and would not be able to get callstacks if it is not. That's reason for x86 and x64 specific exe's.
