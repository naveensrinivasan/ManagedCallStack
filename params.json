The API as of now does not provide values for the local variables. When it is available we can update it. It is a single executable without any other dll's. It uses [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) to embed dll.\r\n\r\nThis is built using [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime/)  \r\n \r\nThe debug shim works specific to processor and would not be able to get callstacks if it is not. So x86 exe cannot get call-stacks of x64. That's reason for x86 and x64 specific exe's. There is no difference in code other than how it is compiled.\r\n\r\n [Download 64Bit Version executable](https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/ManagedCallStack/releases/download/Alpha/ManagedCallStack-x64.zip)  \r\n [Download 32Bit Version executable](https://github.com/naveensrinivasan/ManagedCallStack/releases/download/Alpha/ManagedCallStack-x86.zip)\r\n\r\n![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naveensrinivasan/ManagedStackExplorer/master/screenshot.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
